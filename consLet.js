/* 2.	const and let: We can use const and let instead of var keyword. But we have to know clearly when we use const keyword and when we use let keyword. If we know that we will not change the value of a variable, we should use const keyword. 
const ourCountry = “Bangladesh”;
const pi = 3.1416;
It is not possible to change the value of ourCountry and pi variables. So, we should use const keyword before them. 
But sometimes we cannot sure that the value of a variable can be changed or not. So, at that case, we should not use const keyword. Then, we should let keyword. 
let age = 15;
If we use const keyword and will change the value of a variable, there will be an error. But if we use let keyword, we change or not, but there will not be any error occurred. */
